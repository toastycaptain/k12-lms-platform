Track unresolved questions, blocked tasks, and pending decisions here.

## Format

| # | Blocker | Owner | Status | Date Raised |
|---|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Local environments with Ruby `< 4.0` cannot execute `apps/core` checks due Rails 8.1/Bundler 4 lockfile requirements. | Platform | Open | 2026-02-14 |
| 2 | AI gateway had no dependency manifest or committed tests, so regressions were not CI-detectable. | Platform | Mitigated | 2026-02-14 |
