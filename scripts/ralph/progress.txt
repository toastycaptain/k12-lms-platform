# Ralph Progress Log — K-12 Planning + LMS Platform
# This file is append-only. Each iteration adds learnings below.

## Project Context
- Monorepo: apps/web (Next.js), apps/core (Rails API-only), apps/ai-gateway (FastAPI)
- Multi-tenant: every table has tenant_id
- Auth: OmniAuth Google OIDC + SAML
- API: JSON REST under /api/v1
- See docs/ for full PRD, Tech Spec, and UX Spec

## Codebase Patterns
- Ruby 4.0.1 via Homebrew at /opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin
- PostgreSQL 16 via Homebrew, service: `brew services start postgresql@16`
- PATH must include: /opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:/opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/4.0.0/bin:/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@16/bin
- All rails/bundle commands must be run from apps/core with above PATH set
- Rails 8.1.2 API-only, RSpec 8.0.2, rubocop-rails-omakase for linting
- RSpec configured with FactoryBot, shoulda-matchers, database_cleaner
- spec/support/ directory auto-loaded via glob in rails_helper.rb
- CORS configured in config/initializers/cors.rb with CORS_ORIGINS env var
