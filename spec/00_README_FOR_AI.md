# AI BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (AUTHORITATIVE)

Read and obey these documents in order:

1. PRD_K12_Planning_LMS_AI_Optimized.md
   - Defines product intent, scope, constraints
   - Highest authority

2. TECH_SPEC_K12_Planning_LMS.md
   - Defines system architecture and contracts
   - Must not violate PRD constraints

3. UX_SPEC_K12_Planning_LMS.md
   - Defines screen flows and UX patterns
   - Must not introduce new features

Execution rules:
- Do not invent features not listed in the PRD
- Do not contradict earlier documents
- Ask for clarification if conflicts are detected

## What to Build Next

The platform is feature-complete (Batches 1–6 done). Two batches remain:

**If Batch 7 is not complete:**
  → Read: CODEX_REMAINING_WORK_MASTER_INDEX.md  (start here — full index)
  → Read: CODEX_BATCH7_MASTER_EXECUTION.md      (execution protocol)
  → Read: CODEX_BATCH7_PLAN.md                  (plan and dependencies)

**If Batch 7 is complete and Batch 8 is not:**
  → Read: CODEX_REMAINING_WORK_MASTER_INDEX.md  (start here — full index)
  → Read: CODEX_BATCH8_MASTER_EXECUTION.md      (execution protocol)
  → Read: CODEX_BATCH8_PLAN.md                  (plan and dependencies)

CODEX_REMAINING_WORK_MASTER_INDEX.md is the single source of truth for
all remaining work. Always start there.
