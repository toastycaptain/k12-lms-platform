# FamilyApp (SwiftUI Scaffold)

This folder contains a native iOS family app scaffold that complements the student app.

Current scope implemented:

- App core environment config (`Dev/Staging/Prod`)
- Session bootstrap (`GET /api/v1/me`) and CSRF-aware API client
- Family dashboard icon grid with the requested sections:
  - Attendance
  - Assignments
  - Announcements
  - Timetable
  - Reports
  - Messaging
  - Portfolio (placeholder)
  - Calendar
- Dedicated feature modules for each dashboard destination under `Features/*`
- Classes Today list rendered below dashboard icons
- Portfolio placeholder module with analytics hooks

Notes:

- API calls remain under `/api/v1`.
- Portfolio live mode is disabled by default (`portfolioLiveEnabled = false`).
- Sign-in bypass is enabled by default for local testing (`K12_IOS_FAMILY_AUTH_BYPASS=true`).
