- School policies and resources
- Announcements

## Icon Correlation (One icon per feature)
- Timeline: `clock.arrow.circlepath`
- Add Post: `square.and.pencil`
- Schedule: `calendar.badge.clock`
- To-Do: `checklist`
- Policies & Resources: `building.columns`
- Announcements: `megaphone`

## Sequential Execution Files
1. `iOS/CODEX_IOS_TEACHER_APP_PHASE_01_SCAFFOLD_AND_SESSION.md`
2. `iOS/CODEX_IOS_TEACHER_APP_PHASE_02_DASHBOARD_AND_NAV.md`
3. `iOS/CODEX_IOS_TEACHER_APP_PHASE_03_FEATURE_MODULES.md`
